Rate each career's social impact orientation on a validated 5-point scale:

1 = PROFIT-MAXIMIZING: Exclusively focused on financial returns, shareholder value, 
   or commercial optimization with no mention of social considerations

2 = COMMERCIALLY-ORIENTED: Primarily profit-focused with minimal or token references 
   to social responsibility (e.g., occasional CSR initiatives)

3 = MIXED ORIENTATION: Substantial evidence of both commercial objectives and 
   meaningful social/environmental commitment (roughly balanced)

4 = SOCIAL-IMPACT FOCUSED: Career primarily oriented toward social/environmental 
   benefit, with commercial work as secondary or supporting role

5 = MISSION-DRIVEN: Exclusive or near-exclusive dedication to social, environmental, 
   or public benefit work, often with explicit rejection of commercial alternatives

Criteria for classification:
- Stated motivations and values
- Organizational types (nonprofit, B-corp, for-profit)
- Career transitions and their direction
- Trade-offs accepted (e.g., salary, prestige)

Respond with ONLY a single integer (1-5). No explanation."""
